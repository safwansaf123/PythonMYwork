# python uses only Interpretation
# typscript uses compiler and transpiler


#Interpretation
#An interpreter translates code into machine code line by line, executing each line as it goes. This means:
#Execution starts immediately, without waiting for the entire program to be translated.
#Errors are reported as they are encountered, making debugging easier.
#Programs can be run on any machine that has the appropriate interpreter.

#Compilation
#A compiler translates the entire code into machine code before execution. This means:
#The entire program is analyzed and translated into an executable file.
#Errors are reported all at once after the entire program is checked.
#The resulting machine code can be executed independently of the original source code.

#Transpiler
# A transpiler, also known as a source-to-source compiler, translates code from one high-level programming language 
# to another high-level programming language. The goal is to maintain the same level of abstraction while changing the language.
