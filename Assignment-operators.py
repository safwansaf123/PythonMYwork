#Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

#       operators   example         same as

#       =	        x = 5	        x = 5
#       +=	        x += 3	        x = x + 3	
#       -=	        x -= 3	        x = x - 3	
#       *=	        x *= 3	        x = x * 3	
#       /=	        x /= 3	        x = x / 3	
#       %=	        x %= 3	        x = x % 3	
#       //=	        x //= 3	        x = x // 3	
#       **=	        x **= 3	        x = x ** 3	
#       &=	        x &= 3	        x = x & 3	
#       |=	        x |= 3	        x = x | 3	
#       ^=	        x ^= 3	        x = x ^ 3	
#       >>=	        x >>= 3	        x = x >> 3	
#       <<=	        x <<= 3	        x = x << 3	
#       :=	        print(x := 3)	x = 3 print(x)
